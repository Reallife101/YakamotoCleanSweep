Introduction:
	This level is the tutorial level. Thus,

1. There should be no weapons!
2. Therefore, there is no dirty object. Just reach the end of the stage.

Settings:
	In this stage, the player must go through a tutorial. The player starts from the back rooms of an observatory and run through the observatory. For the game, I wanted a futuristic setting. I'm thinking Mirror's Edge - minimalist and clean with bright colors. For this introduction stage, you are in training to be a cleaning agent. Go through the course to receive your license to clean!
