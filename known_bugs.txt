1. puddle textures can show up through walls and dont work well on slanted surfaces
2. if i switch weapons while reloading, i cannot use that weapon again until i reload a second time
(ex. i am at 4/5 ammo and try to reload but switch first. when i switch back, i still can't
fire, even though i still have the 4 ammo)
3. UI/UX issue : menus look wierd a wide aspect ratios
4. audio menu does not work
